 - prove that the resulting color uses 2d+1 colors
   - induction on size of graph
   - two new colors each time
   - base case: no more high degree vertices, color with phase2
 - there are no more high-degree nodes (this is the hypothesis for phase2)
 - need to identify the terminal properties for phase1 to supply to phase2
 *)
(* induction on M.cardinal g *)
Check phase1.
(* Lemmas:
- you can color any graph with max degree + 1 colors
- can prove 3*(sqrt n) + 1
 *)



(* Some notes about how the algorithm will be written:

- we will not pass proofs that the graph is 3-colorable all the time,
  since later we want to talk about robustness

- we want to break down algorithm enough to reason about the graph and
  the coloring at each step while still making the overall algorithm
  clear

- an important lemma we will use repeatedly is that we can combine OK
  disjoint colorings into larger colorings, and that the number of
  colors used is the size of the palette

- to show that the coloring is complete, we show that a vertex must be
  one of the following:

1) a high-degree vertex, in which case it's colored by phase 1
2) a neighbor of a high-degree vertex, in which case it's colored by phase 1
3) a low-degree vertex, in which case it's colored by phase 2
 *)

(*
We define phase 1 of the algorithm in several pieces:

two_color_step takes:
  - a graph g
  - a high-degree vertex v
  - the current color number c
two_color_step outputs:
  - a complete coloring of N(v) using colors c+1, c+2
note:
  - phase 1 will color v with c
  - the expectation is that two_color_step will be called with another
    vertex and c+2

so phase 1 will fold over the list of high-degree vertices Lv and do:
- the state of the fold will be (c,m), where c is a number and m is the coloring
- call two_color_step on each vertex to produce the coloring and update m
- update c to c+2

we will have to show that:

- the resulting tuple will be (d,m), where d is the number of high-degree
  vertices and m is the coloring of all the neighborhoods of high-degree vertices
- d*d <= k
- the number of colors used is 2*d

random lemmas that we have to show:
- it's decidable to check whether a node is colored or not (WF.In_Dec)
- the number of high-degree vertices cannot exceed sqrt(k)
